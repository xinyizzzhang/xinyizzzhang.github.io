I'm a Ph.D. student at Osaka University at [Harada Lab.](https://www.roboticmanipulation.org/) in [Osaka University](https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en), advised by [Professor Kensuke Harada](http://www.hlab.sys.es.osaka-u.ac.jp/people/harada/). My research interests include perception and planning for vision-based industrial picking under complex scenarios. I received my M.E. from Osaka University and B.E. from Tianjin University, China. 

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
