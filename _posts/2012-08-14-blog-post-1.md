Let's assume we have two computers, their names are `jack` and `rose`. We want to run ROS master on computer `jack`, and connect with this ROS master on computer `rose`. Once this communication is establish, we can use computer `rose` to echo rostopic or call rosservice, or other things. 

### 1. Establish physical connections

This is very simple, we may use a Network switch or router to connect computers. 

### 2. Verify the name and IP of your computers

You can find computer name on ubuntu by

`vi /etc/hostname`

and you can find the IP by

`ifconfig`

In our case, we find one computer with the name `jack` and IP `10.0.1.1`, another with the name `rose` and IP `10.0.1.2`. 

Next thing, on computer `jack` you can run `ping 10.0.1.2` while on computer `rose` you can run `ping 10.0.1.1` to check if their can communicate each other. 

### 3. Link the hostname and IP

Open `vi /etc/hosts` you may see things like 

`127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 jack
`
add another computer IP + name on it, if you open it on computer `jack`, you add `10.0.1.2 rose`. If you open it on computer `rose`, you add `10.0.1.1 jack`. 

And then you may
